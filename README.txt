PROBLEM 1: 
Analyze the text for word length frequency. We might expect short words to be more common than long words. But, are words of length 2 more common than words or length 3? Are words of length 3 more common that words of length 4? Use Python to read in a given text ﬁle and count the frequency of each word length in the text.

PROBLEM 2:
Analyze the text for letter frequency. If you’ve taken a crypto course and/or have seen substitution ciphers then you are probably aware that ’e’ is the most common letter used in the English language. Use Python to read in a given text ﬁle and count the frequency of each letter in the text. 

PROBLEM 3:
 If we really wanted to crack a substitution cipher (or win on ”Wheel of Fortune”) then we should be aware that, although ’e’ is the most common letter used in English, it may not be the most common ﬁrst letter in a word. Use Python to read a given text ﬁle and count the positional frequencies of each letter. Speciﬁcally, count the number of times each letter appears as the ﬁrst letter in a word, as the last letter in a word, and as an interior letter in a word (i.e. a letter that is neither ﬁrst nor last). While your initial solution may require multiple passes over the text, make sure that your ﬁnal solution computes the frequencies in only a single pass over the text. Note: Words of length 2 or less have no middle letters.
